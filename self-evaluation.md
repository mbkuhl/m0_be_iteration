- How might the `each` method be useful?

The each method is useful to perform a repetitive function on a collection of varaibles. Additionally it can be used to sort this data in a variety of ways by performing  repetitive function.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?

I need to practice learning how to use new methods to perform tasks that I can think up but can't do using only the material in the Mod 0 assignments.
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?

Once I decided that I needed to look up how to check a string length as opposed to trying to find weird ways, it was all good from there.
